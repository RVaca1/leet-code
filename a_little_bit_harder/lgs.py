# problem: Longest Consecutive Sequence
#
# Description:
# Given an unsorted list of integers nums, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence of numbers.
# The consecutive numbers don’t have to be in order — just consecutive when sorted.
#
# You must write an O(n) solution (i.e., no full sorting).
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] has length 9.
